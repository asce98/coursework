        <h2>Growth of ECommerce in Nepal</h2>

            <p> 
                The COVID-19 pandemic has had a transformative impact on the global economy, with e-commerce being one of the sectors that experienced significant growth. This trend was also evident in Nepal, where businesses capitalized on the surge in online opportunities induced by the pandemic.
                As the pandemic spread and lockdowns were imposed, consumers in Nepal increasingly turned to online shopping. Businesses like Sabji Land, which sells fresh organic fruits and vegetables, saw its online sales grow by 60% since the outbreak. More established online businesses, such as Thulo.com, Nepal's largest online supermarket, reported a sales surge of more than 200% from 2019 to 2020.
                This shift in consumer behavior was facilitated by government reforms and initiatives in response to an eTrade readiness assessment of Nepal done by UNCTAD and the Enhanced Integrated Framework in 2017. These reforms addressed key bottlenecks in the country's e-commerce ecosystem and helped build citizens' confidence in making digital payments.
                However, the growth of e-commerce in Nepal was not without challenges. Despite the increase in online transactions, digital literacy, digital divide, and trust remained major hurdles for the industry. Many Nepalese still preferred cash transactions, and changing this behavior was a gradual process.
                In conclusion, the COVID-19 pandemic has reshaped the retail landscape in Nepal, driving the growth of e-commerce, changing consumer behaviors, and forcing businesses to adapt to a new reality. This trend is likely to continue even as the world gradually recovers from the pandemic. However, addressing the challenges of digital literacy and trust will be crucial for the sustained growth of e-commerce in Nepal.

        <h2>Online Payment System</h2>

        <p>
            The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly accelerated the adoption of mobile banking and online payment systems in Nepal. As lockdowns were imposed and people were confined to their homes, traditional banking took a backseat, paving the way for digital transactions. Mobile banking transactions in Nepal saw a sharp increase, with the number of transactions soaring to 71.42 million during the review period, up from 48.54 million transactions during the period mid-June to mid-July 2021. Similarly, online payment systems also witnessed a surge, with digital payments swelling by 18 percent year-on-year in the final month of the last fiscal year to cross the Rs6 trillion mark. The pandemic-induced shift towards a digital economy has not only changed the way Nepalis make payments but also forced businesses to adapt to a new reality. Despite the challenges, this trend is likely to continue post-pandemic, signaling a new era of digital transactions in Nepal.
